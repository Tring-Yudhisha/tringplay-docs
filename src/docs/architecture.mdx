# Architecture Overview

## 3.1 Configuration-Driven Architecture

TringPlay is powered by a central configuration file (referred to as **Remote Configuration**). This configuration controls:

- Authentication type
- Subscription provider
- Feature availability
- UI behavior
- Theme and branding
- Platform-specific behavior

Configuration changes do not require a new build or app store resubmission.

## 3.2 Backend Independence

The TringPlay apps communicate through:

- **Configurable API base URLs**
- **Standardized response contracts**

This allows:

- Easy backend replacement or migration
- Integration with custom or third-party CMS and user systems

# Application Initialization
